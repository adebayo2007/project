        <div class="here">
            <h3>Here are a few things to look for:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A good security guard company will have a solid reputation. Ask around and see what others have to say about the company.</li>
                <li>The company should be licensed and insured to protect you if anything goes wrong.</li>
                <li>Ensure the company does a thorough background check on all employees.

        <div class="armed">
            <h1>Armed Security</h1>
            <p>Our professionally trained armed security guards are here for your business security needs, with 24/7 licensed security guards available to meet your objectives. Businesses with high-value items or those that accept cash need to be protected by trained, armed security guards. Some construction or haulage companies that pay contract workers in cash require additional protection. Businesses that deal with valuables or prescription pharmaceuticals, such as banks and financial institutions, jewelry stores, pawn shops, and medical facilities, require increased protection. Many of our Security's licensed officers have significant training and are former law enforcement or military personnel. Our top-tier security guards endure a rigorous screening procedure that includes credit and background checks, reference checks, and drug testing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="unarmed">
            <h1>Unarmed Security</h1>
            <p>Without the ability to carry a firearm, an unarmed security professional must use a careful eye and sometimes a physical weapon, such as a baton or pepper spray, to guard a building, employees, and assets. The guard's professional appearance gives a sense of authority enough to deter certain situations, such as theft or vandalism. Having firearms present doesn't always help since they can escalate situations far more than they need to be. Unarmed security guards can remain calm when under pressure while maintaining control.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="fire">
            <h1>Fire Safety</h1>
            <p>Government fire codes require a fireguard and fire safety director for large buildings and construction sites.  In a large commercial or residential building with an out-of-service fire alarm, sprinkler, or standpipe, there must be fireguards present. Fireguards are also necessary at construction sites without fire suppression systems, or where open flame is in use. SECURE AGENCY have trained fire guards whose job includes monitoring fire-related systems, making fire reports, and coordinating orderly fire evacuations. All our fire guards are certified following applicable law.</p>
